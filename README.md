# Stock-price-prediction-using-ML

This project was built using Python, and as the name suggests it is simply used to forecast the price
of the future of stock. For this the SP 500 dataset is used and using that dataset first the data frame is
prepared and then for using linear regression the data frame is divided into training and testing sets
and the price is predicted with 95 percent accuracy.
